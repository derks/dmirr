Feature Enhancements:

    * :issue:`72` - Added new framework hooks.

      cement_on_close_hook() allowing plugins/extensions/etc to be able to
      cleanup on application exit.

    
Incompatible Changes:

    * :issue:`72` - The framework hooks 'cement_add_args_hook' and 
      'cement_validate_config' were removed in favor of the new pre/post setup 
      and run hooks.
